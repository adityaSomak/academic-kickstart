I am actively looking to take motivated Ph.D, MTeach and BTech students who are interested in pursuing their thesis in the exciting juncture where classical AI, and statistical AI meets. For prospective students, please read the FAQs (will be updated). 

<h3> FAQs for Propsective Students </h3>
<!-- Some answers are tailored towards Ph.D students; but should be applicable to MTech and BTech thesis students as well.

<span style="font-weight: bold"> What are the projects that you will be working on? </span><br/>
The long-term goal of our lab is to achieve  Transparent Human-aware AI systems through Logic and Reasoning. We want the AI systems to be able to <em>reason-in-the-wild</em> and do so transparently for the end-users with whom it is expected to interact. Technically, we will work on the fundamental challenges faced by current neural and probabilistic logical systems in achieving such properties. 
A few of them are:
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><i class="fa-li fas fa-star fa-xs" style="color:black;"></i> How do we reason transparently? What does it mean to reason transparently? </li>
<li><i class="fa-li fas fa-star fa-xs" style="color:black;"></i> How do we reason with noisy and incomplete knowledge sources? Can we utilize semi-structured (or more natural) forms of knowledge representation?  </li>
<li><i class="fa-li fas fa-star fa-xs" style="color:black;"></i> How do we elicit missing knowledge? </li>
<li><i class="fa-li fas fa-star fa-xs" style="color:black;"></i> How can human-in-the-loop help? </li>
</ul>

See the <a href="/#projects/">project page</a> and publications to see how solving such technical challenges may affect a range of applications -- from NLP, Vision, to automated mathematical reasoning.

<!-- <li> 
<span style="font-weight: bold"> How often do you want to meet with your students? Will there be lab meetings etc.? </span><br/>
Depends on the project and student. Meetings will be more frequent near deadlines and short-term projects. 
Things will slowly evolve as we become bigger. So, if you join now, you can play a significant part in defining how the lab will take shape.

<!-- <li> 
<span style="font-weight: bold"> How do I know that my mindset rightly aligns with you? </span><br/>
I would love to welcome everyone whoever shows interest. However, your individual passion, self-motivation, punctuality and sense of responsibility are incredibly improtant to thrive in a competitive and collaborative research environment. So, I would expect that from all members.

Furthermore, through our work, we will attempt to make theoretically sound yet practically relevant contributions (which is easier said than done). So, if you have an appreciation for the theoretical roots of CS, and a desire to make impactful and quantifiable progress in practical applications; that makes you a perfect fit.

Last, but not the least, having fun and enjoying your tenure here is non-negotiable! :)

<!-- your success in the lab will depend on a few factors. There is a saying that I love -- "wherever you go, there you are". Your individual self-motivation, resilience, and passion about research is irreplacable and would be the central factors controlling the outcome of your research. Apart from passion, CS research is often highly collborative. So, punctuality, and a sense of responsibility are also essential to thrive in such an enviornment. -->
<!-- <li> 
<span style="font-weight: bold"> In general, how much freedom will I get to explore? </span><br/>
For starting PhDs, I will set you onto a path with some rough plan towards a long-term goal. As we explore and after your first few publications, you are expected be able to independently sketch your own path. This is important for Ph.D students, as Ph.D is all about the training to become an independent researcher. 

The same goes for MTech and BTech students, in a somewhat fast-tracked way. Initially, students often require certain period of training, which can be best achieved by participating in ongoing projects in the lab. Then, I will expect you to slowly pitch in your ideas and solidify the specific problem that you wish to work on. For a sponsored project however, you might be expected to work towards a high-level goal set by the sponsor and myself. But, we will always be open to exploring new ideas.
