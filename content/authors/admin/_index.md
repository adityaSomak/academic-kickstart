I have joined [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) as a Postdoctoral Researcher. 
At MSRI, with Dr. Monojit Choudhury, I am exploring *evaluation* and *enhancement* of Neural language models using the combined theories of Language and Logic. Our exploration leads us to consider both traditional neural models and neuro-symbolic variants. Parallel to exploring neuro(symbolic) methods in the context of NLI, I am also exploring multi-hop reasoning capabilities of neural methods in symbolic domains with Dr. Navin Goyal. 

Overall, my central goal in research has been devloping models that learns from data, yet enriched by knowledge and capable of reasoning with such knowledge. 
Developing such models require three central considerations: *knowledge acquisition*, *representation* and *reasoning*. 
At MSRI and during my PhD, a fundamental observation was that, often an  equal measure of concentration is required for each application.

During my doctoral studies, my efforts revolved around Image Understanding under the supervision of [Prof. Chitta Baral](http://www.public.asu.edu/~cbaral/) (Past President of KR.inc, 2016-2018). 
I was also co-advised by [Dr. Yezhou Yang](http://yezhouyang.engineering.asu.edu/) (Assistant Professor, ASU). 
Through a combination of Deep Learning, Knowledge Representation and Probabilistic Logical Reasoning; I demonstrated the benefits of using reasoning and knowledge in Visual Question-Answering (IJCAI, AAAI), Captioning (CVIU), image puzzle solving (UAI) and visual reasoning (WACV). I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [CIDSE, Arizona State University](http://cidse.engineering.asu.edu/) on June 27, 2018.

 
I completed my Masters (ME) in Computer Science from the [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](http://www.csa.iisc.ernet.in/) in 2011 with a concentration in 
Machine Learning under the supervision of [Prof. M Narasimha Murty](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VQZTmpcAAAAJ&hl=en) (Dean, Faculty of Engineering, IISc). 
I have done my Bachelors in CS from Jadavpur University in 2009. Prior to joining PhD, I worked as a developer in the Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) team at Strand Life Sciences 
for nearly 2.5 years.
