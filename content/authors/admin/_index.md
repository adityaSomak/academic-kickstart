<!-- <span style="color: red">!!! Major Update: I have joined IIT Kharagpur CSE as an Assistant Professor on November 2021. I am looking for motivated Ph.D, MTech, and BTech students. !!!</span> <br/> -->
I am an Assistant Professor (Grade I) at IIT Kharagpur Department of CSE. I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) advised by Dr. Monojit Choudhury. Prior to joining MSR India, I spent 1.5 years in Adobe Research as a full-time Researcher. I completed by Ph.D from [CIDSE, Arizona State University](http://cidse.engineering.asu.edu/) in June 2018, under the supervision of [Prof. Chitta Baral](http://www.public.asu.edu/~cbaral/) and [Prof. Yezhou Yang](http://yezhouyang.engineering.asu.edu/). 

Deployable AI systems should be able to reason with knowledge that is commonplace to humans. Thus, my research aims to <b>enhance, evaluate,</b> and <b>explain</b> different types of complex <b>reasoning abilities</b> of AI systems. At MSRI, I explored *evaluation* and *enhancement* of reasoning capabilities of Transformers-based language models. Apart from end-to-end reasoning, I am paralley exploring multi-hop reasoning capabilities of neural methods in both [symbolic](https://adityasomak.github.io/project/symbolicmath/) and [natural language](https://adityasomak.github.io/project/nlp/) domains. During my Ph.D, I have explored *enhancement* of reasoning capabilities of [image understanding](https://adityasomak.github.io/project/pslvqa/) systems. Through a combination of Deep Learning, Knowledge Representation, and Probabilistic Logical Reasoning, I demonstrated the benefits of using reasoning and knowledge in Visual Question-Answering, Captioning, image puzzle solving and visual reasoning. 


<!-- My past work has been driven by two fundamental hypotheses: 1) knowledge and reasoning is fundamental to machine understanding (irrespective of the input modality), and 2) different types of reasoning may require different types of methods (deviating from *one-model-to-rule-them-all*). Lastly, to build deployable AI systems, interpretability and human-AI (extrinsic) trust is essential. In future, I would also explore how knowledge and reasoning plays a role in interpretable trusted AI systems. -->

<!-- my agenda in research is to devlop models that simultaneously learns from data, while being enriched by knowledge and capable of reasoning with such knowledge. 
Developing such models require three central considerations: *knowledge acquisition*, *representation* and *reasoning*. 
At MSRI and during my PhD, a fundamental observation was that, often an  equal measure of concentration is required for each application. -->

<!-- I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [CIDSE, Arizona State University](http://cidse.engineering.asu.edu/). During my doctoral studies, 
Through a combination of Deep Learning, Knowledge Representation and Probabilistic Logical Reasoning; I demonstrated the benefits of using reasoning and knowledge in Visual Question-Answering (IJCAI, AAAI), Captioning (CVIU), image puzzle solving (UAI) and visual reasoning (WACV). -->
 
<!-- I completed my Masters (ME) in Computer Science from the [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](http://www.csa.iisc.ernet.in/) in 2011 with a concentration in 
Machine Learning under the supervision of [Prof. M Narasimha Murty](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VQZTmpcAAAAJ&hl=en) (Dean, Faculty of Engineering, IISc). 
I have done my Bachelors in CS from Jadavpur University in 2009. Prior to joining PhD, I worked as a developer in the Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) team at Strand Life Sciences 
for nearly 2.5 years.  -->
