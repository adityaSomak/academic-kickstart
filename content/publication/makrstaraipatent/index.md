In some embodiments, a knowledge graph generation system extracts noun-phrases from sentences of a knowledge corpora and determines the relations between the noun-phrases based on a relation classifier that is configured to predict a relation between a pair of entities without restricting the entities to a set of named entities. The knowledge graph generation system further generates a sub-graph for each of the sentences based on the noun-phrases and the determined relations. Nodes or entities of the sub-graph represent the non-phrases in the sentence and edges represent the relations between the noun-phrases connected by the respective edges. The knowledge graph generation system merges the sub-graphs to generate the knowledge graph for the knowledge corpora.
